			<h2>What is Sky?</h2>
			<p>Sky:Children of light is a MMO... In Sky: Children of the Light, the player explores a magical kingdom using a cape that gives them the ability to fly. There are seven unique realms to visit, and each one is themed around a different stage of life. In addition to these realms, there is a Home that serves as a hub between the different realms. </p>
			
			<p>Throughout the game, the player will encounter "spirits" that give the player cosmetic and gameplay-affecting items in return for in-game currency. The player can also find "lost stars" that give the player "winged light". When the player has collected enough winged light, their cape level goes up, increasing their maximum "wing energy" and allowing them to fly farther.</p>
			<p>
			Sky features a heavy focus on social mechanics. Players are able to meet and befriend one another, and can unlock new abilities such as chat and sending gifts as their friendship grows.</p>

			<p>In Sky, there are many cosmetic items to collect including capes, masks, hairstyles, hats, pants, playable musical instruments, expressions, and more. These items can be obtained using in-game currency.</p>
